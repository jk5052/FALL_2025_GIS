    "text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Thursday condemned President Trump for calling for the execution of six Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a video urging U.S. service members to refuse unlawful orders.\n \n“The president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials. This is an outright threat and it’s deadly serious,” he said on the Senate floor. “When Donald Trump uses the language of execution and treason, some of his supporters may very well listen. He is lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.”\n \nEarlier in the day, President Trump posted on social media that the lawmakers’ actions were “seditious” and reposted 16 Truth Social messages, including one calling for the lawmakers to be hanged.\n \n“It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,” the president wrote. “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand - We won’t have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET.”\n \n“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” he added in another post.\n \nSen. Schumer said “no president has ever stooped as low” and said he must be held accountable.\n \n“He’s made political violence a feature of his politics, and if we don’t draw a line here, there’s no line left to draw,” he said.\n \nThe lawmakers targeted in the president’s posts — Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly (AZ) and Elissa Slotkin (MI), and Reps. Jason Crow (CO), Chrissy Houlahan (PA), Maggie Goodlander (NH) and Chris Deluzio (PA) — all previously served in the military or worked in national security.\n \n“Americans trust their military. But that trust is at risk. This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” they said. “Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad, but from right here at home. Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n#chuckschumer #trump #cspan ",

    "text": "FIVE THINGS TO DO IN NEW YORK that are not eating or drinking (winter edition) \n1. Go to the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. I was truly amazed at how in sync the dancers were. It was a great show. \n2. Get the viral $40 blowout in Chinatown. No joke my hair has never felt cleaner, they shampoo your hair twice and give you a shoulder massage. I highly recommend!! \n3. Another great option would be to go ice-skating at The Rink at the Rockefeller Center. The tree will be lit December 3 this year!! Definitely a cool experience, especially if you love the movie Elf. \n4. Check out the viral Old Friend Photo Booth, which is at 117 Orchard St. These photos come out so cute, they are black and white definitely a vibe. I’m pretty sure they were seven dollars for two. \n5. Go to the holiday pop-up on 5th Ave. So many different stores had booths here with holiday gifts, merchandise, snacks, viral foods, hot chocolates they even had ice-skating!\n\nHave fun!! \n\n#thingstodoinnewyork #christmasinnewyork #winterinnewyork #newyork #newyorkcity #iceskating #rockettes #radiocitymusichall #rockefellercenter #elfmovie #viralblowouts #chinatownblowouts #5thavenue #holidaypopup #winterishere #newyorkwinter #viralnewyork #nyc #shopping ",
